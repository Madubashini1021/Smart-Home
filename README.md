# Smart-Home
Statistical Analysis on smart home energy consumption data, evaluating environmental impact (temperature, humidity, solar power).

The "Smart Home: Weather vs. Energy" case study examines how environmental factors and power generation sources affect energy usage in smart homes. This topic is critical because understanding these influences can help optimize energy consumption, leading to cost savings, enhanced energy efficiency, and environmental benefits. We seek to determine the correlations between factors that affect smart home energy usage by utilizing weather, energy production, and consumption data. 

A.	 Challenges 
Among the difficulties faced are:
•	 Coordinating and combining vast amounts of heterogeneous data from multiple sources.
•	Addressing missing or duplicate values and guaranteeing data consistency and quality.
•	Determining pertinent environmental elements that affect smart home energy use, either directly or indirectly.
 
B.	  Objective and Requirements

Research Question: 

1.	How do various environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation, influence energy consumption patterns and the efficiency of energy management systems in smart homes? 

2.	What is the impact of different power generation sources, particularly solar power, on total energy consumption and management strategies in smart homes? 

3.	How do relationships between indoor energy usage from specific appliances (like dishwashers and heating systems) and overall energy consumption inform strategies for optimizing energy efficiency in smart homes?
